## Nessus Essentials Lab: Vulnerability Management

### Description
Todayâ€™s lab is focused on Vulnerability Management. We will build a Vulnerability Management Lab by installing Nessus Essentials on our host machine and creating a virtual environment using VMWare Workstation 17. This involves downloading a free copy of the Windows 10 operating system and running it inside a virtual machine (VM). Additionally, we'll install some old, deprecated software on the Windows OS. The objective is to conduct vulnerability scans against the virtual machine to discover any vulnerabilities present. Subsequently, we will remediate one or two of those vulnerabilities to observe real-time outcomes.

#### Scan Procedure:
1. **Non-Credentialed Scan (Pre-Update):**
    - Conduct a vulnerability scan without credentials before applying any updates to the target machine.

2. **Credentialed Scan (Pre-Update):**
    - Perform a vulnerability scan with credentials before applying any updates to the target machine.

3. **Credentialed Scan (Post-Update):**
    - Execute a vulnerability scan with credentials after applying updates to the target VM.

At the conclusion of this lab, we will compare the results of the three scans to analyze the effectiveness of the vulnerability management process.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Provisioning and Deprovisioning Virtual Environments:**
    - Set up and remove virtual environments within VMware for Windows 10.

2. **Initial Vulnerability Scan (Non-Credentialed):**
    - Conduct an initial vulnerability scan without credentials against the VM and observe the results.

3. **Credentialed Vulnerability Scan with Deprecated Software:**
    - Run a credentialed vulnerability scan after adding deprecated software to the VM.

4. **Analysis and Remediation:**
    - Analyze scan results, perform remediation of identified issues, and run a final scan to verify successful remediation.

## Technologies and Protocols

- VMware Workstation 17 Player
- Nessus Essentials
- Windows ISO + Firefox 3.6.12

**NOTE:** This lab will be conducted on a Windows machine.

## Part 4: Configure Target Virtual Machine Firewall

1. **Get Target VM IP Address:**
   - On the target VM, open `cmd.exe`.
   - Run the command `ipconfig` to retrieve the IP address of the VM.

2. **Ping Target VM from Host Machine:**
   - On the host machine, open `cmd.exe`.
   - Run the command `ping <target_VM_IP_address> -t` to continuously ping the target VM.
   - Replace `<target_VM_IP_address>` with the IP address obtained from step 1.

3. **Observe Firewall Settings:**
   - If the ping requests result in "Request Timed-Out," it indicates that the firewall settings on the target VM are preventing scanning.

![Windows](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*fYPku0pBptjF2X2B.PNG)

**NOTE:** We must change firewall settings on the Target VM in order to scan it and run Nessus against it.

1. **Turn Off Firewall Profiles:**
   - On the Target VM, go to the Search Bar and type `wf.msc`.
   - In the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security window, turn off the Domain, Private, and Public Profiles.

2. **Verify Connection:**
   - Immediately after turning off the firewall profiles, verify the connection by pinging the target VM again.
   - If the ping returns a result, it indicates that the firewall settings have been successfully modified, and we can proceed with the scanning process.

## Results and Takeaways

### Scan 1: Target Re-configured (Credentialed) Results
- **Risk Rating Percentage:**
   - Critical: 2.00%
   - High: 2.00%
   - Medium: 2.00%
   - Low: 0.00%
   - Info: 95.00%
   - Total: 100.00%

Non-credentialed scans are not as useful as credentialed scans when trying to get an accurate view of vulnerabilities that exist on a device or network because they lack proper access. Non-credentialed scans cannot see vulnerabilities that may exist on parts of a device or network that are off limits without proper authentication. As a result, non-credentialed scans produce far fewer results than credentialed scans. That makes credentials very important to a threat actor because of the access it gives them. Run credentialed scans when possible.

### Scan 2: Firefox (Credentialed) Results
- **Risk Rating Percentage:**
   - Critical: 27.00%
   - High: 26.00%
   - Medium: 6.00%
   - Low: 0.00%
   - Info: 40.00%
   - Total: 100.00%

The second credentialed scan was on a target running third-party software that was outdated. Even if the target VM was running an up-to-date OS, the third-party software would still leave it open to attacks. The more third-party software you have installed, the larger the attack surface you create. Zero trust and system hardening are ways to minimize your attack surface so that you minimize your vulnerability count.

### Scan 3: Remediated (Credentialed) Results
- **Risk Rating Percentage:**
   - Critical: 2.00%
   - High: 2.00%
   - Medium: 2.00%
   - Low: 0.00%
   - Info: 94.00%
   - Total: 100.00%

The third credentialed scan after remediations were implemented shows far fewer vulnerabilities than the previous credentialed scans run before updates were applied. These results demonstrate the importance of scheduling regular vulnerability scans against networks and devices. They also show that keeping systems up to date with the latest patches can drastically reduce the number of vulnerabilities an attacker could exploit.
